# Chapter 12 - IO Project

This is a simple IO project that replicates `grep` but with Rust.

The project is fairly straightforward, taking command line arguments for a query and a file path to search in. This program combines a few topics such as Error Handling, Automated Tests, and handling lifetimes for objects.

How to run:

```zsh
cargo run -- to poem.txt
```
